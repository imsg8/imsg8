Hey there, folks! It's me, @imsg8, also known as Shivang Gulati. I'm a huge tech enthusiast and a creative soul combined into a single person. 🚀 Right now, I'm a little knee-deep in iOS App Development and exploring the fascinating world of AI. It keeps me awake at night, and I am loving every minute of it, hopefully, at least till now lol. 👀

There's more to me than just coding and tech! I've got a crazy huge passion for music directing - producing, snapping photos - mostly wildlife and sometimes people and portraits, running a podcast show that I started as a teenager, and yes, I've got a liking for numbers and math, though I don't score the top grade in it but anyway,, psst. It's like I've got one foot in the world of tech and the other in the realm of art and I don't wish to stumble at all, pray for me haha xD.

💞️ What gets me going though is collaboration and getting to know perspectives, and how different people approach different things. I want to team up with like-minded individuals who share my passion for pushing boundaries to come up with innovative solutions. So, if you've got a project that's all about merging technology with creativity, I'm your go-to guy!

📫 Wanna connect? Shoot me an email at shivangclicks@gmail.com and I will try to reply at your earliest convenience. Let's brainstorm, code, create, and conquer together, yayy! 🚀🎶✨
